Recomendations for using with reshade
-------------------------------------

Since this was created for me to use with ReShade and was tested with it, here is few words about it.

1. Result of subjective personal testing shows that 18x lut from this collection is the Beast and will give you better result than default ReShade's x32 lut. So you can take 8bit version of it and be on your way!

2. If you feel like going for bigger guns there is very small difference between 52 and 86 luts. Bigger IS more accurate, but difference is less than you could expect (could be because ReShade have troubles with using x86 size lut)

3. Recommended way of using â€” make your adjustments on 16 bit version, but convert it to 8bit before giving it to ReShade



x64 LUT
-------

And here is small bonus.
16 bit x64 lut
[64x64x64 16bit](NotPerfect/OBS16bit.png?raw=true)

It was created for use with OBS Studio, it's not perfect, but results seems more interesting than ones that default lut could offer.
If your software supports different LUT sizes, my recommendation would be ignore it and use files from above

Thanks for reading, I wish you juicy color correction ;)
